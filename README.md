# Mongo-Social-Backend

Mongo-Social-Backend is an application designed to recreate the back end of a social media website. The entire site is ran on Node.js, and all data and routing must be utilized through an API development platform like Insomnia.

## Key Features

Mongoose.js: This application uses the Mongoose.js library to format schemas for interacting with MongoDB. All models and schemas we're created in Mongoose.js.

Express.js: This application uses the Express.js library for routing.

The Routes: The routes permit the site to create, edit, delete, and update different users. One can also create and delete friends for individual users, add "thoughts" to individual users (similar to a post on a social media website), and create reactions to said thoughts.

## Getting Started

To use this application, follow these steps:

Install npm,
Run the server with "node server.js",
Test routes in an API development platform using JSON format.

## System Requirements

Must have an API tester.
